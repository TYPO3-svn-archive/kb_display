* When a "compareField" is selected, hide "compareValue" field

* Create code (compare template) which handles the "compareField"

* Find a reasonable guideline when to use "t3lib_div::sysLog" or "t3lib_div::devLog"

* Write documentation for filters (lib/class.tx_kbdisplay_queryCriteria.php) TypoScript options



* Classes\Query\...: The classes in here should eventually extend a base class "sqlQueryComponent" which defines to which
  part of the query (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUPBY, ...) the result is set to and supply a common interface
